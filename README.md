# Gas-rich dwarf galaxies as a new probe of dark matter interactions with ordinary matter
Code repository associated with the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12190 by Digvijay Wadekar and Glennys Farrar.

We obtain constraints on various dark matter models using observations of gas-rich dwarf galaxies.
